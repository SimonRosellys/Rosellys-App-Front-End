### **What Does This App Do?**

The Rosellys-App is a band management tool designed to help with the organisation of shows, songs and specific set lists for each show. All of this information can be shared with each member of the band who will each have access to amend or add details.

This is the frontend repo for the Rosellys-App API.
This app allows you to view, edit and delete data through a user friendly interface.

There is a test version running on Netlify at:
